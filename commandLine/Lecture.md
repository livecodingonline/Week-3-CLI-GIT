# CLI  (Command language Interpreter)
## Command line
The command line (cli, shell) is the interface between  user and the operating system which interprets the commands and allows the computer to respond to the command.


## General syntax
`command_name param1 param2 [OPTIONS]`
In the above, square brackets denote the optional part of the command.
The square brackets are not supposed to be typed.
`param1` and `param2` are COMPULSORY parameters.
## Some commonly used commands

`ls` - show the contents of the directory. `ls -a` will show all hidden files. `ls -l` will show more files in long format (more details)

`pwd` - print the Present Working Directory. What directory am I in? 

`cd` - change directory to the one specified. If no directory is specified this will take you to your home directory. Remember that `.` is the current directory and `..` is the parent directory. So `cd .` changes the directory to the current directory (does nothing!). 

`echo` - prints the string on screen (on desktop/bash terminal). `echo -e "hello\n"` will interpret `\n` as newline.

`cat` - print the contents of the file - this will print the WHOLE file. If you want to pause printing after a full screen use the below command.

`less` - show one screen full of the file (spacebar/Enter moves forward and q stops printing)

`head` - show the beginning of a file e.g. `head -3` shows the first 3 lines of the file

`tail` - show the end of a file `tail -4` shows the last 4 lines of the file

`tail -f -100` - shows last 100 lines of a log file, while it's being updated. The output of the command will be automatically updated as well. This is the best way to watch logs.

`wc` - show the word count of a file (prints number of lines, words and characters in the file)

`CTRL-c` - stop what is happening on the command line 

`CTRL-z` - hard stop what is happening on the command line 

`mkdir` - create a new directory

`touch` - create an empty file
